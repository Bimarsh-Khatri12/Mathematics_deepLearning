# Mathematics_deepLearning
Inside Rubric 1 file there are two files one for the mathematical computational of linear algebra with given code demonstration and other files contain a project demonstration of implmentation of linear algebra in machine learning to perform certain task
Input and output file are stored on data file inside rubric 1.

**Note : cat.jpg is input folder and Compressed_image.jpg is output image obtained after compression**

The gradient descent.docx file contain mathematical computational of forward and backward operation. It also contain a sample code for gradient descent algorithm implementation and step to obrain 4th order polynomial using gradient descent.
