Inside Rubric 1 file there are two files one for the mathematical computational of linear algebra with given code demonstration and other files contain a project demonstration of implmentation of linear algebra in machine learning to perform certain task

The gradient descent.docx file contain mathematical computational of forward and backward operation. It also contain a sample code for gradient descent algorithm implementation and step to obrain 4th order polynomial using gradient descent.
