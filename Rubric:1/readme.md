There are two files 1. Implementatio of SVD which discusses about the implementation of SVD. The file illustrate the computational mathematics and linear algebra concepts behind the implementation.
The second files SVD_ImageCompression is a small project done to show how SVD can be implemented for image compression. 

Note: However, for second file I didnot use the long mathematical computational for code version for getting result. I simply used numpy and its in-built function to perform computational task due to its convinence.
